# Project Title

Library_Contract

## Description

The code defines a contract called LibraryContract for managing a library's book collection. It includes a dictionary variable Books that maps book titles to book objects. The contract provides a function addBook to add books to the collection. The Book struct defines the properties of a book, and an initializer is used to set the values. The contract's initialization function sets the initial state with an empty Books dictionary.
